# Password Hashing Script

This script hashes a given password using a specified hashing algorithm. It utilizes Python's `argparse` and `hashlib` modules to parse command line arguments and perform the hashing operation, respectively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the script to your machine.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing the command `python hash_password.py` (assuming the script file is named `hash_password.py`), followed by the password you want to hash, and optionally, the hashing algorithm of your choice.

```bash
# Example:
python hashing_password.py mypassword --type sha512
```
